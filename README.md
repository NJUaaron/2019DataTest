# 2019DataTest
  This is the place at where dataset and implement code are stored for paper
"Is Bigger Data Better for Defect Prediction: Examining the Impact of Data Size on Supervised and Unsupervised Defect Prediction"  
  
  Dataset folder contains 11 project folds, corresponding to the merged projects mentioned in paper.
Code folder contains implements of analysis methods, evaluation measures and predicion models.
We conceal sundry code lines used for sanitizing data and data batch processing. Only critical algorithm implement are presented
in this repertory.
If you would like to get more information about our experimence. It's welcome to email aaron2019nvd@163.com.
